# Microwave Simulator

Cook your food and not your CPU.

---

## Why?

Because I want to learn the basics of a few more languages, and class is boring as hell.

## Contributing

If for some reason you want to contribute to this unholy abomination project, feel free. Create a new folder with the name of your language and a file with the code inside that folder, named something like "microwave.extension". Match functionality as closely as you can to the C version, but feel free to throw in some extra error handling if you'd like. I did it myself in the Go and Rust versions.
